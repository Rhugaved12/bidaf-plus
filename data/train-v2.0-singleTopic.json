Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time. In the 18th century, Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom. This and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease. Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the miasma theory. It was not until Robert Koch's 1891 proofs, for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905, that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease.

As with B cells, each type of T cell recognizes a different antigen. Killer T cells are activated when their T cell receptor (TCR) binds to this specific antigen in a complex with the MHC Class I receptor of another cell. Recognition of this MHC:antigen complex is aided by a co-receptor on the T cell, called CD8. The T cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the MHC I receptors bear this antigen. When an activated T cell contacts such cells, it releases cytotoxins, such as perforin, which form pores in the target cell's plasma membrane, allowing ions, water and toxins to enter. The entry of another toxin called granulysin (a protease) induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis. T cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses. T cell activation is tightly controlled and generally requires a very strong MHC/antigen activation signal, or additional activation signals provided by \"helper\" T cells (see below)."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What co-receptor recruits molecules inside the T cell that are responsible for cell activation?", "id": "6cb5f2ad2d3c0ae91fb78dad5", "answers": [{"text": "CD4 co-receptor", "answer_start": 166}, {"text": "CD4", "answer_start": 166}, {"text": "CD4 co-receptor", "answer_start": 166}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many receptors on a helper T cell must be bound to a MHC:antigen complex in order for the cell to be activated?", "id": "09ad8bc4aaad8cac3bed30d2c", "answers": [{"text": "around 200\u2013300", "answer_start": 416}, {"text": "around 200\u2013300", "answer_start": 416}, {"text": "around 200\u2013300", "answer_start": 416}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The receptors on a killer T cell must bind to how many MHC: antigen complexes in order to activate the cell?", "id": "1aaacbdc426f5a5fedaea4645", "answers": [{"text": "a single MHC:antigen molecule", "answer_start": 578}, {"text": "single", "answer_start": 580}, {"text": "a single MHC:antigen molecule", "answer_start": 578}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Activation of a helper T cell causes it to release what chemicals that influence cell activity?", "id": "32ffd3fefd0804c9ef8a50a14", "answers": [{"text": "cytokines", "answer_start": 774}, {"text": "cytokines", "answer_start": 774}, {"text": "cytokines", "answer_start": 774}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is a ligand on the cell surface that is upregulated after helper T cell activation?", "id": "ea0ea7ab7bfd282edcda09bcd", "answers": [{"text": "CD40 ligand", "answer_start": 1078}, {"text": "CD40", "answer_start": 1078}, {"text": "CD40 ligand", "answer_start": 1078}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules", "answer_start": 61}], "question": "What antigens do Helper T cells not recognize?", "id": "c5af9a547c64254dea1f38f06", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Helper T cells", "answer_start": 288}], "question": "What has a stronger association with the MHC:antigen complex than killer T cells?", "id": "ade2e24637b6fa0dbe1fd635b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule", "answer_start": 564}], "question": "What are killer T cells dis-activated by?", "id": "e0ba45c3f1b47314eeebfc5f7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "cytokines", "answer_start": 774}], "question": "What do helper T cells absorb?", "id": "b93ccbd84da2116edcdd4fbcb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "antibody", "answer_start": 1182}], "question": "What do B cells help T cells produce?", "id": "21703cedcfd4ff5f6080066d9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Helper T cells express T cell receptors (TCR) that recognize antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules.

Immune complexes (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions.

Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies, rendering them ineffective; examples include Streptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus aureus (protein A), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (protein L)."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the process by which the adaptive immune system is evaded by the chainging of non-essential epitopes called?", "id": "325df39e7b26e2eeb679f78c8", "answers": [{"text": "antigenic variation", "answer_start": 263}, {"text": "antigenic variation", "answer_start": 263}, {"text": "antigenic variation", "answer_start": 263}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is an example of a virus that uses antigenic variation?", "id": "edaab392e9d31db84c8aa4e3a", "answers": [{"text": "HIV", "answer_start": 298}, {"text": "HIV", "answer_start": 298}, {"text": "HIV", "answer_start": 298}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is an example of a parasite that used the antigenic variation strategy to evade destruction?", "id": "0f1ec85f1880e60be06ea1d1e", "answers": [{"text": "Trypanosoma brucei", "answer_start": 553}, {"text": "Trypanosoma brucei", "answer_start": 553}, {"text": "Trypanosoma brucei", "answer_start": 553}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What compounds can be masked with the molecules of the host cell in order for a virus to evade detection?", "id": "39d1d4da66e32af3eddcbbf6a", "answers": [{"text": "antigens", "answer_start": 728}, {"text": "antigens", "answer_start": 728}, {"text": "antigens", "answer_start": 728}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "evade the adaptive immune system", "answer_start": 23}], "question": "What are the less complex mechanisms used to do?", "id": "2b5c5c9ccbee4f121889a489d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "rapidly change non-essential epitopes", "answer_start": 106}], "question": "What is the most complex way to avoid the adaptive immune system?", "id": "2b20a7e3a7899e22700abfdd7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "HIV", "answer_start": 298}], "question": "What is a pathogen that does not use antigenic variation?", "id": "d1f05be9c6ebac6a78eebecf6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "frequent changes in antigens", "answer_start": 450}], "question": "What does not explain the failure of vaccines directed at the HIV virus?", "id": "ff2c7d3c9b67bec6b8cc388d8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Trypanosoma brucei", "answer_start": 553}], "question": "What is a parasite that always uses the same surface protein?", "id": "5d6049bf2fff778ec69b6312b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The mechanisms used to evade the adaptive immune system are more complicated. The simplest approach is to rapidly change non-essential epitopes (amino acids and/or sugars) on the surface of the pathogen, while keeping essential epitopes concealed. This is called antigenic variation. An example is HIV, which mutates rapidly, so the proteins on its viral envelope that are essential for entry into its host target cell are constantly changing. These frequent changes in antigens may explain the failures of vaccines directed at this virus. The parasite Trypanosoma brucei uses a similar strategy, constantly switching one type of surface protein for another, allowing it to stay one step ahead of the antibody response. Masking antigens with host molecules is another common strategy for avoiding detection by the immune system. In HIV, the envelope that covers the virion is formed from the outermost membrane of the host cell; such \"self-cloaked\" viruses make it difficult for the immune system to identify them as \"non-self\" structures."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the process by which the immune system identifies tumors called?", "id": "37aa39d2fe680ecbcaab3abed", "answers": [{"text": "immune surveillance", "answer_start": 96}, {"text": "immune surveillance", "answer_start": 96}, {"text": "immune surveillance", "answer_start": 96}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the virus in humans that causes cervical cancer?", "id": "bfbccada7c77beaddce465e4f", "answers": [{"text": "human papillomavirus", "answer_start": 433}, {"text": "human papillomavirus", "answer_start": 433}, {"text": "human papillomavirus", "answer_start": 433}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is an example of an enzyme that can transform skin cells into tumors when expressed at high levels?", "id": "2c7055ab6b04b0e0b3214aba2", "answers": [{"text": "tyrosinase", "answer_start": 641}, {"text": "tyrosinase", "answer_start": 641}, {"text": "tyrosinase", "answer_start": 641}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are cancerous tumors of the skin known as?", "id": "9dbc679fb46ba6e0d67bdade9", "answers": [{"text": "melanomas", "answer_start": 757}, {"text": "melanomas", "answer_start": 757}, {"text": "melanomas", "answer_start": 757}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are the skin cells that can be transformed into tumors known as?", "id": "eb910fab426a921ec03f73a97", "answers": [{"text": "melanocytes", "answer_start": 725}, {"text": "melanocytes", "answer_start": 725}, {"text": "melanocytes", "answer_start": 725}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "identify and eliminate tumors", "answer_start": 50}], "question": "What is not an important role of the immune system?", "id": "9fba9daabd5c13c7b8d4fb795", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "antigens", "answer_start": 157}], "question": "What do tumors express that are also found on normal cells?", "id": "ccca3f7d4095bfdccfc7fa719", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "oncogenic viruses", "answer_start": 410}], "question": "What is not a cause of tumor antigens?", "id": "f2d017bd463afb443afcf7fdb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "transforms certain skin cells (e.g. melanocytes) into tumors", "answer_start": 689}], "question": "What happens when tyrosinase is expressed at low levels?", "id": "a2dbdcb1cb7e8bf80cc6efeed", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "oncogenes", "answer_start": 942}], "question": "What is a fourth possible source for tumor antigens?", "id": "15eef4ea2e9f9e7b30237eacb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Another important role of the immune system is to identify and eliminate tumors.

Early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids; however, more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins, as a training set. A publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by B cells.

These signals induce a pro-inflammatory state through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1, interleukin-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. These cytokines then stimulate immune functions such as immune cells activation, proliferation, and differentiation. It is during this time that undifferentiated, or less differentiated, like na\u00efve and central memory T cells, peak (i.e. during a time of a slowly evolving adaptive immune response). In addition to these effects, the milieu of hormones produced at this time (leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin) support the interactions between APCs and T-cells, a shift of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance towards one that supports Th1, an increase in overall Th cell proliferation, and na\u00efve T cell migration to lymph nodes.
